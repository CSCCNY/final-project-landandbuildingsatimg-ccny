### Discussion points

- Everyone gave progress update:
    - JB provided research paper documents; explore Unet architecture  
    - HG finished image processing work and will begin the integration into tensorflow  
    - JM Looked into DeepGlobal dataset and started working on notebooks for the preprocessing.
    - SM made a presentation showing 3 approaches that are going to be used to the land use land cover classification accoring to the literarure (ResNet50, UNet, SegNet)                 (presentation called Update 4_22.pptx is located in reports/meeting_ppt/4_22/)

- Deliverables for THURSDAY
    - JB: organize research paper references; develop initial CNN architecture 
    - HG will continue to work on getting the pipeline established
    - JM Notebook and script to read DeepGlob as a keras dataset.  
    - SM will focus on code running ResNet50 and SegNet models

- Weeks to deadline = about 3 weeks  
    - Week 1 image processing  
    - Week 2 model integration and train  
    - Week 3 testing difference models  
    - Week 4 evaluation
