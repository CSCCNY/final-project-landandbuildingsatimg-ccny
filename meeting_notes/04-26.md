    - SM finished to run the ResNet

- Deliverables for THURSDAY
    - JB: organize research paper references; develop initial CNN architecture 
    - HG will continue to work on getting the pipeline established
    - JM Folders with splitted images for model training.  
    - SM will looking into real image from

- Weeks to deadline = about 3 weeks

    - Week 2 model integration and train  
    - Week 3 testing difference models  
    - Week 4 evaluation
