### Discussion points

- Everyone gave progress update:
    - JB talked about an example that uses Unet for road detection and explained how we can implement it for our project  
    - HG talked about image processing for space net challenge 
    - JM talked about the progress, still debating what input sources to use for the land classification  
        - Decided to use Deep globe land classification segmentation dataset 
    - SM talked about current progress  but will migrate to using deepglobe stuff 


- Deliverables for WED 
    - JM will have a preprocessing test for data and have it labeled  
    - JB: organize research paper references; develop initial CNN architecture 
    - HG will finish image processing and have it ready  
    - SM will start looking at the NN codes and figure out how to link with images  


- Weeks to deadline = about 4 weeks  
    - Week 1 image processing  
    - Week 2 model integration and train  
    - Week 3 testing difference models  
    - Week 4 evaluation
