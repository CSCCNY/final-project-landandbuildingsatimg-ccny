### Discussion points

- Main Objective
    - Run land classification and when it detects urban area, run building detection algorithm  
    - Merge the two sub projects 


- Two subgroups
    - Building detection (Harold Gamarro and JB ) 
    - Land classification (Juan Montoya and Said Mejia) 


- How to organized the project  
    - Use teams for note taking  
    - Use GitHub to track computer code 
    - Main library to reuse code between two sub projects 
    - Create a python library 
    - Setup code that is also executable 
    - Github subfolder structure

- To do for Thursday  
    - Setup the github folder  
    - Open training data  
    - Start exploratory data analysis  
    - Replicate the neural network that comes with training data and find tutorials (make sure to always commit everything we do)
