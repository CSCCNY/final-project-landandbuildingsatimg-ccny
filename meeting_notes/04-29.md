### Discussion points

- Everyone gave progress update:
    - JB  
    - HG: Finished getting input data ready for model, tested the setup using a Unet from JB. Initiall test worked after stuggling to find a way to overcome OOM errors for the large data files. Solution was to use research Lab HPC cluster and train on a compute node with 60 GB of memory. Setup works well and can be used by everyon in the project since we all have access to the resource.
    - JM 
    - SM downloaded and processed the sentinel dataset (the data were converted from jp2 to png)

- Deliverables for THURSDAY
    - JB: 
    - HG:  Will use same process of data ingest to get JM and SM dataset model ready. Will also begin model development with JB. 
    - JM 
    - SM look into the segnet model and predict the classes for a big image using the ResNet model

- Weeks to deadline = about 3 weeks  
    - ~~Week 1 image processing~~  
    - Week 2 model integration and train  
    - Week 3 testing difference models  
    - Week 4 evaluation
